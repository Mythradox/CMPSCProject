# CMPSCProject

Asteroids-like game written in C w/ SDL. Unfinished because of scope creep and lack of knowledge :(

# Controls

Up/W: Accelerate

Left/A and Right/D: Change Rotation

Space: Dash!

# Dependencies

- SDL2
- SDL2_image
- SDL2_mixer

# Build

Works only in GNU/Linux; W*ndows users shall taste my shoe

I use Arch btw so I'd do something like this, just get these packages:

```
sudo pacman -S sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_mixer
```
Then do this:

```
cd [directory]

make
```
